<h2>Welcome from the CARISCA Centre Director</h2>
<p>I warmly welcome you to the Centre for Applied Research and Innovation in Supply Chain – Africa (CARISCA), where great minds take on significant development challenges in supply chains. CARISCA is an interdisciplinary centre of excellence established at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in partnership with Arizona State University (ASU). The centre is envisioned as a globally recognized, locally owned hub for generating and translating innovative research into positive development outcomes for Ghanaian and pan-African supply chains.</p>
<p>The Centre is harnessing innovative research in supply chain management, drawing on the social sciences, industrial and systems engineering, computer science, mathematics, economics, marketing, finance, and management, to take on significant development challenges and address barriers to development caused by inefficient and ineffective supply chains. The centre’s focus on supply chain management and innovation reflects a large body of research showing that efficient local supply chains are crucial to local, regional, and national economic development.</p>
<p>The CARISCA Centre is positioned to be Africa’s preeminent source of supply chain management expertise. It is a resource for researchers across Africa to drive innovative research, research translation (applying research findings to policy, practice, or additional research), and training to improve African supply chains, sustained by revenue-generating activities and a robust partner network. The Centre focuses on significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of health care and agricultural value chains across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>We are partnering with international, regional and national research institutions to lead cutting-edge research in supply chains that publishes in some of the most prestigious international scholarly journals, and that provides insights for supply chain practitioners and policymakers. We are also collaborating with networks of industry leaders, policymakers and trade associations to connect African researchers, practitioners, and businesses to global supply chain assets. We have the most diverse and internationally recognized academic programs in the supply chain, procurement, logistics, and transportation management in the West African sub-region. We are the only center of excellence in West Africa to hold the twin global professional accreditation for the Chartered Institution of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) and Chartered Institute of Logistics &amp; Transport (CILT), making us one of the very few accredited study centers to train supply chain professionals in the sub-region.</p>
<p>CARISCA is your globally connected partner for supply chain research, training, and policy. We provide a one-stop-shop for research capacity development, internationally accredited academic programs, and C-suite executive and professional training programs in supply chain management.</p>
<p>We are committed to collaborating with you to advance your supply chain research, executive training, and policy development needs.</p>
<p>Welcome aboard!</p>

<h2>About ASN-RA</h2>
<p>The Africa Supply Network Research Accelerator (ASN-RA) is inspired by Arizona State University’s Complex Adaptive Supply Networks Research Accelerator (CASN-RA) model. Designed to catalyze innovative and collaborative research in supply networks, ASN-RA brings together emerging scholars from across Africa.</p>
<p>In its inaugural edition, 21 researchers from seven African countries, namely Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Uganda, were selected to participate. The meeting led to forming five research teams, each working on projects aimed at publication in top-tier, peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p>ASN-RA is a significant milestone for CARISCA. It advances our mission to:</p>
<ul><li>Strengthen research capacity for Africa’s next generation of supply chain scholars</li><li>Facilitate access to cutting-edge methodologies and global academic networks</li><li>Foster long-term research partnerships across the continent and beyond</li></ul>
<p>The ASN-RA meeting is held biennially, rotating among partner institutions across Africa, to ensure broader regional inclusion and deepen collaborative ties.</p>
<p>This initiative reflects CARISCA’s commitment to supporting homegrown research excellence and empowering African scholars to shape and share the continent’s supply chain narrative from an African perspective.</p>

<h2>What is the Logistics Managers Index?</h2>
<p>Supply chain managers need good data and information to ensure that vital goods are in stock. To support these decision-makers, CARISCA created the Logistics Managers Index (LMI) for Ghana. CARISCA released its first LMI report in June 2022. The calculated LMI for Ghana, along with the accompanying analysis of its components, provide useful insights for the government of Ghana, business decision-makers, market analysts, and investors, as it offers a predictive indicator of overall economic activity in Ghana.</p>
<p>The Ghana LMI is the first of its kind in Africa, and a significant step toward supply chain efficiency, visibility and transparency in Ghana. A reading above 50 indicates growth in logistics activity; below 50 indicates contraction.</p>
<p>The LMI report is published quarterly. Senior executives and managers of Ghanaian organisations are invited to participate in the quarterly LMI surveys.</p>`,
